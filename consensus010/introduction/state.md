# State

One important aspect and challenge of a decentralised distributed network, is to ensure that every node in the network arrives at the same state. Put another way, all nodes in the network should all agree on the state of the network. The state should only change according to some set of rules, and once the state has changed then all nodes should eventually agree on the new state.

In systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the state is the **blockchain. **The set of rules that allow the state to change is called the **consensus protocol.**

**The author would like to add an example using graphs, however he would not like to generalise as some graph implementations vary.**
