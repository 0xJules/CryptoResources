# Distributed And Decentralised Systems

#### Distributed Systems

The definition for what a distributed system is will change depending on the person you are asking.

The author will use the following definition for the remaining of the book:

> A distributed system is a system that has no central geographical region.

This definition will be sufficient enough in order to understand consensus algorithms.

#### Decentralised Systems

##### Politically Decentralised Systems

> A politically decentralised system is one that has no central authority. No one individual or organisation can control the system.

##### Architecturally Decentralised Systems

> An architecturally decentralised system is similar to a distributed system, in that it is a system with no central geographical location and can therefore tolerate the failure of some amount of physical computers on the network.

##### Logically Decentralised Systems

> A logically decentralised system is one that has no central location for the logic of the system. A logically decentralised system will behave like a single machine and have one shared state.

_The definitions for a decentralised system are referenced from Vitalik Buterin: _[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)





**The author is considering adding "centralisation" for finality**
