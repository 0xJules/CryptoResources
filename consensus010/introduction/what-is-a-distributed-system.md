# Distributed And Decentralised Systems

_Not suitable for consumption_

#### Distributed Systems

The definition for what a distributed system is will change depending on the person you are asking.

The author will use the following definition for the remaining of the book:

> A distributed system is a system that has some set of nodes, that are connected by a network. The goal of a distributed system is to make the network work as if it were a single node. In Bitcoin, to the outside world it would seem as if the network is working as a single node to compute blocks.

This definition will be sufficient enough in order to understand consensus algorithms.

#### Decentralised Systems

##### Politically Decentralised Systems

> A politically decentralised system is one that has no central authority. No one individual or organisation can control the system.

##### Architecturally Decentralised Systems

> An architecturally decentralised system is similar to a distributed system, in that it is a system with no central geographical location and can therefore tolerate the failure of some amount of physical computers on the network.

##### Logically Decentralised Systems

> A logically decentralised system is one that has no central location for the logic of the system. A logically decentralised system will behave like a single machine and have one shared state.

_The definitions for a decentralised system are referenced from Vitalik Buterin: _[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)

**The author is considering adding "centralisation" for finality.**

**The author will clarify the fact that some people say distributed when they mean decentralisation and vice versa**

The goal of a distributed decentralised system is for every participating node to arrive at the same state.



With a distributed system it is more about the **where **is the calculation being done

With a centralised and decentralised network, the question is a **who **, as in who is authorising the calculations.

Centralised distributed: One node is authorising the calculations and the result is delivered to him. Sort of like a master slave definition.

decentralised distributed: No single authority authorises the calculation, the results are shared upon each node.



If you can point to a single person in the network or minority organisation who has the authority to initiate a process, then it is not politically decentralised.
