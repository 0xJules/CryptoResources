# Consensus Protocol

Decentralised networks use consensus protocols to arrive at a shared state.

A consensus protocol has three properties:

* Liveliness
* Safety
* Fault Tolerance

Consensus algorithms must be byzantine fault tolerant. So the consensus algorithm must allow the system to operate even if nodes exhibit byzantine failures or fail-stop failures. _This is not true by FLP, as a system can be liveliness and fault tolerant only._

The remaing chapters of this book will inform the reader, on the consensus algorithms used in cryptocurrency that allow the system to have byzantine fault tolerance.

**The author would like to include the two generals problem, the byzantine generals problem and the runtime for BGP.**

Practical BFT was introduced as a solution for BGP, which is derived from Two generals.
