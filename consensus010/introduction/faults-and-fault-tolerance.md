# Faults and Fault Tolerance

Nodes on a decentralised system may experience faults at any moment.

Examples of such faults:

* Crashing
* Crashing and Looping
* Ddos
* Corruption of data
* Bug in Code
* Hacked
* Hardware problem
* Accidental delete

When building decentralised system it is important to account for the possible failures that a single node may experience. Most of these failures can be automated away with scripts. For example, if your system crashes, then a script can be written to reboot it.
