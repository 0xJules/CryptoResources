# Example consensus algorithm

## What is 'Example consensus algorithm'?

This section wil be split into two parts. A quick summary section, that will sum up the algorithm in a paragraph or so. And a detailed summary part that will go into detail on how the algorithm is implemented. This will be similar to the high-level overview and low-level overview in bitcoin010.

##### Simple Summary

##### Detailed Summary

## Advantages

This section will list all of the advantages of using this particular consensus algorithm. Header format with a short sentence that goes into detail on why it is an advantage

##### Example advantage

Short sentence talking about why it is an advantage or how it is an advantage or how the advantage is accomplished

## Disadvantage

This section does the same thing as advtanges, except it will be for disadvantages.

##### Example disadvantage

Short sentence talking about why it is an disadvantage or how it is an disadvantage or how the disadvantage is accomplished

## Possible Attack Vectors

This section will talk about possible attack vectors and how or why they can be done via this algorithm.

##### An Example attack vector 

Short or long sentence talking about what the attack vector is and how it will be initiated.
