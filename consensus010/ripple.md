# Ripple Consensus Protocol

Outlining the definitions made by the ripple consensus white paper:

**Server**: A server is any entity running the Ripple Server software \(as opposed to the Ripple Client software which only lets a user send and receive funds\), which participates in the consensus process.

_This means that if you would like to use the ripple network to send funds, it is open in that sense. It is only permissioned, when discussing becoming a validator. A server in the ripple consensus paper will be seen as a validator. A normal user is not mentioned._
