# Plan

This book will list all of the algorithms used in cryptocurrency and their advantages and disadvantages, including possible attack vectors

* What is a consensus algorithm?
* Page that shows the algorithms, then a list showing what cryptocurrencies use it. And maybe a percentage of coins that use it in the top100, hopefully will be able to extend it out to all coins on coinmarketcap. Glossary Page
* For each algorithm, explain what it does, then the advantages and then the disadvantages. For the disadvanages this could include the possible attack vector
* Then again, attack vectors are different to disadvantages, for example a disadvantage of POW is it's massive latency but a possible attack vector could be the 51% attack
