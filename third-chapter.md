#### Merkle Roots and Tress

**High Level Explanation**

For arguments purpose, I will assume that if you are reading this, you are one alive and two you had parents.  Now what if instead of your mum marrying your dad, she married Fred. You would not exist. Your mum and your dad, are the only combination of people who could have conceived you. If either your mum or your dad was not in the equation, then you would not exist. Let's take this further, what if your grandma decided to not marry your grand father. Your mum would not exist, and subsequently you would not exist. You can imagine the tree, would look like the below image:

Notice Oliver at the top? If any one of the below family members change, then he will change or cease to exist.

We will call the guy at the very top, the **family root. **He is the glue that connects every single other member together. We will call the other members **family leaves** and the structure you see above will be called a **family tree**.

One day a really old lady walks up to Oliver and says "I am a part of your family tree. My name is Brenda". How would Oliver verify this? Efficiently? Without going through every family member?
