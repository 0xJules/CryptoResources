**Symmetric Encryption**

**High level overview**



Imagine yourself in a room with a box. You have one key and this key like a real key, opens and closes the box. If you want to hide anything in the box from someone else, you must ensure that they do not have a copy of the key.  
  
**Low level overview**

Encrypting is the process of converting a plain message into a secret message. The process of encryption is used to hide the original message from anyone who does not know how to decrypt the message.  
  
Decrypting is the process of converting a secret message back into the plain message. 

With symmetric encryption, a key is used to encrypt the plain message and this same key is used to decrypt the secret message. 



One example of a symmetric key algorithm, is that of a letter shift. The key is how many times you shift the letters.  
  
If key is 1, the letter a when encrypted becomes 'b'.

If key is 2, the letter a becomes 'c'

if key is 3, the letter d becomes a 'g'



The sentence 'hello' with a key of 2 becomes 'jgnnq'. In order to decrypt this, the receiver must know the key, 2. The process would be the reverse of the encryption.
