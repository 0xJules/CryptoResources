# **What Is Money?**

Money has been in our lives since the day we were born and much like the air we breathe, when asked to define what it is, we are lost for words.

Let's go back a couple hundreds of years, when we were trading cows and goats for services. Cows and Goats for all intensive purposes was seen as money. We were trading animals for services and products.

I go to a tracktor dealership and I ask to trade 10 of my chickens for a new tracktor. The owner does not want chickens, he says he wants 2 horses. If I want the tracktor, I must now find a way of trading my 10 chickens for 2 horses, I must also have space on my farm to look after the horses. This process of bartering is not convenient and not scalable.

Fast forward a bit, and we have Gold. Everyone is trading Gold for services and products. The problem with Gold is that it is not very portable, imagine carrying around 100kg of Gold to buy a new car. Your chances of not getting robbed while transporting the money would be slim.

Fast forward a bit, and instead of Gold. What if we traded 1kg of gold for 1 us dollar. This one US dollar would signify that I do in fact have one kilogram of Gold somewhere locked up and you can get that one kilogram of Gold with this one US dollar. This US dollar \_represents \_the Gold. Money that is backed by some commodity is called representative.

Before we continue, I would like to point out a couple of nuances with what we have discussed so far. Money is not a natural component in our lives, it has been artificially added into society. It is more of a social and political construct, much like some languages are. The reason I say social is because if you tried to pay for an iPhone with 10 cows in 2018, it would not be accepted. It is not an acceptable form of currency in todays society. It does still have monetary value, I will not be emphasizing the economic construct of money, as this is something that most of us are already familiar with. Now imagine going back 1000 years into the past, with a billion dollars. What would you have been able to buy? Nothing. That was not the social construct for what money was. The takeaway point, is that notes, a hundred dollar bill, checks, coins, a fifty pound note, all of these things do not encapsulate what money is. Because we had money a thousand years ago, but we did not have notes a thousand years ago.

So what is money? Money is similar to a scale.
