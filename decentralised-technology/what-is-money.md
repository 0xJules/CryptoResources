# **What Is Money And The Motivation For Bitcoin?**

_This is an optional topic._

Money has been in our lives since the day we were born and much like the air we breathe, when asked to define what it is, we are lost for words.

Let's go back a couple hundreds of years, when we were trading cows and goats for services. Cows and Goats for all intensive purposes was seen as money. We were trading animals for services and products.

I go to a tracktor dealership and I ask to trade 10 of my chickens for a new tracktor. The owner does not want chickens, he says he wants 2 horses. If I want the tracktor, I must now find a way of trading my 10 chickens for 2 horses, I must also have space on my farm to look after the horses. This process of bartering is not convenient and not scalable.

Fast forward a bit, and we have Gold. Everyone is trading Gold for services and products. The problem with Gold is that it is not very portable, imagine carrying around 100kg of Gold to buy a new car. Your chances of not getting robbed while transporting the money would be slim.

Fast forward a bit, and instead of Gold. What if we traded 1kg of gold for 1 us dollar. This one US dollar would signify that I do in fact have one kilogram of Gold somewhere locked up and you can get that one kilogram of Gold with this one US dollar. This US dollar represents the Gold. Money that is backed by some commodity is called representative.

Before we continue, I would like to point out a couple of nuances with what we have discussed so far. Money is not a natural component in our lives, it has been artificially added into society. It is more of a social and political construct, much like some languages are. The reason I say social is because if you tried to pay for an iPhone with 10 cows in 2018, it would not be accepted. It is not an acceptable form of currency in todays society. It does still have monetary value, I will not be emphasizing the economic construct of money, as this is something that most of us are already familiar with. Now imagine going back 1000 years into the past, with a billion dollars. What would you have been able to buy? Nothing. That was not the social construct for what money was. The takeaway point, is that notes, a hundred dollar bill, checks, coins, a fifty pound note, all of these things do not encapsulate what money is. Because we had money a thousand years ago, but we did not have notes a thousand years ago.

So what is money?

Let's put it another way. If I went to China right now and asked for directions to the closest restaurant. I may be met with a blank stare, this is due to the fact that I don't speak Chinese. Now if we relate this to going back in time with a billion dollars. We can easily see how money can be seen to be a language. In the more literal sense, money talks. If you do not speak "cow money" then you cannot communicate with anyone that does. It would also be ridiculous to demand that we only use one medium as money, it's like telling everyone to only speak one language.

Let's put it another way. Money is a scale in which we use to measure services and products.

How much does that iPhone 8 **cost**. It **costs** $999. I used **money **to measure the value of the iPhone.

How much does Kate **weigh**. She **weighs** 75kg. I used a **scale** to measure her **weight**.

Is this any different to the previous definition? It does not; we use languages to communicate between each other. In the case of the scale, we are trying to communicate the value of a product.

What would happen, if we started manipulating that scale. You have not changed in weight, but everytime you go on it, it measures a different weight. This would not be a suitable item to measure your weight, because it's inconsistent in measuring weights.

Now if money, the scale, kept changing in value would you then class it to be a suitable item to measure the value of other things? To elaborate, imagine putting away $1,000,000 and at the time of storage, it is enough to buy two mansions. You then withdraw the $1,000,000 and the only thing you can buy is a bottle of water.

We talked about representative money where for every note there is an equivalent commodity stored safely away somewhere, however this is not what most 'money' is today. It is money that is backed by nothing. This is what we call Fiat money. Instead of money being created and having a one to one relationship with Gold for example, the money is created by the central bank. We are trusting one organization to regulate the scale. Think back to what happens when you manipulate the scale, it is no longer a trustable source for measuring. One day you work for 10 hours and you get paid $100 and buy gas for your car, then you put away $80 in a piggy bank. The next day, you work the same 10 hours, get paid $100 and can barely afford to buy the same amount of gas for your car.

Bitcoin proposes a Trustless money system, whereby we do not need to trust some central organisation to regulate the scale for us. The scale is regulated using Mathematics. Why is this different to the Central Bank? Because Maths is deterministic and Maths will not and cannot create more money because it thinks it will benefit the whole society. Bitcoin proposes that for any decision to be made, regarding the scale, you must have the majority of people agree with your decision. You could be the President Of America and you still would not be able to change the scale without having the majority of people agree with you. This is a powerful statement, because it means that the scale cannot be regulated by one person or by one central authority, it can only be regulated by the majority, and Bitcoin makes it very costly for a bad actor to attain the majority of the network. The amount of damage you would have done by attaining the majority, would be cancelled out by the cost that you have incurred and put into the Bitcoin network. This all means that in the case of Bitcoin, in order to trust the money, the scale, we must trust that the majority of people will act in a way that is beneficial for you and for them.
