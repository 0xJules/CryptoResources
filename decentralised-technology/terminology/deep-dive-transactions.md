# Deep Dive: Transactions

_This chapter will formally define the term Bitcoin transaction._

Following the UTXO deep dive, I would like to clarify that UTXOs are not the transactions themselves. They are the inputs and outputs of a transaction.

**Breaking Down The Components of A Transaction**

**Transaction ID**

The txid is the unique identifier for a transaction. It is generated by hashing all of the other components in the transaction

_**Version Number: **_

Bitcoin is an evolving software, updates are made and new features are added. Remembering the elected person in the _overview of Bitcoin, _when verifying transactions, he needs to know whether there have been changes to the format of the transaction and whether new features have been added. This version number informs him of such details, as version one transactions follow certain rules. 

**Locktime:**

The locktime is a feature which allows you to specify the earliest time, the elected person should include this transaction into the block. For example, if you specify that this transaction must only be included into the database on Monday 5th March 2019, then this transaction will sit inside of the unconfirmed transactions list, until that time. _Please note that the format for the date is unix. As we have not covered blocks as of yet. We will mention block locktime in a later chapter._
