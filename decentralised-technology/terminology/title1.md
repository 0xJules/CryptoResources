# **The Beginning**

Let's suppose Alice wants to send money to Bob.

How would she do this?

She could meet up with Bob and give him his $5. In this scenario, she will first verify that it is Bob, by looking at him. She will then give the money over to Bob and Bob will acknowledge that he did receive the money. If Alice goes into her pocket and tries to give Charlie the same $5, well she can't, because she just gave it to Bob. Ownership of _that_ $5 has been transferred to Bob.  
In this scenario, it would be silly for Alice to meet Bob and video record it all for her bank to then verify. This in-person transaction did not need a third party.

Doing the same thing online however, is difficult. Without a third party in between. If I sent any digital asset, it would be difficult to track whether I did not send it to someone else first. To test this out, send your friend an image. Now send a different friend the same image. Both friends have no idea, whether you sent that image to someone else and so have no idea, if you still own the image.  
  
What if we decided to make a public database, that everyone can see and whenever a transaction was made, we write it in this public database that everyone can see. This sounds like a good idea, what happens if this database gets hacked? Then we will not know who owns what. We could have an organization guard it and verify transactions for us, however our objective is to move away from central authorities and banks.  
  
What if everyone had the database? There is no longer a single point of failure.
