# **The Beginning**



Let's suppose Alice wants to send money to Bob.   
  
How would she do this?



She could meet up with Bob and give him his $5. In this scenario, she will first verify that it is Bob, by looking at him. She will then give the money over to Bob and Bob will acknowledge that he did receive the money. If Alice goes into her pocket and tries to give Charlie the same $5, well she can't, because she just gave it to Bob. Ownership of _that_ $5 has been transferred to Bob.   
In this scenario, it would be silly for Alice to meet Bob and video record it all for her bank to then verify. This in-person transaction did not need a third party.  
  
Doing the same thing online however, is difficult. Without a third party in between.
