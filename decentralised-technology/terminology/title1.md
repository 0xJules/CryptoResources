# **The Beginning**

This chapter will assume that you have some understanding of bitcoin already. The purpose of this chapter is to solely outline the bitcoin protocol, so that we can dive into the more technical aspects of Bitcoin.  
  
First let's forget about a bitcoin for a moment.  
  
Let's assume that we want to send an image over the internet, and the image is only allowed to be sent once.

How can we assure this?  
  
A centralised solution would be to have a list somewhere that is guarded by a company and in order to send an image, you must tell the company who you are sending it to and what image it is. Before you send it, the company checks to see if you have sent that image to someone else before. When someone receives the image, they also alert the company.   
  
If the company becomes corrupt, then you have no way of proving that images are in fact yours. The same principle applies if they get hacked. The hacker could transfer all ownership of the images to themselves.  
  
The list is clearly needed, the problem is that if only one person has it, then that one person is suddenly God and he can do whatever he wants. So what if everyone had the list?
