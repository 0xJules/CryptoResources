_What are blocks in Bitcoin?_

Recall in the overview of bitcoin section, we mentioned that the elected person, collects transactions into blocks. We referred to them as batches, in the bitcoin protocol we will call them **Blocks. **Blocks do not only contain information about transactions. A block consists of three components, the **block header, the list of transactions and a transaction counter.**

Consensus rules concerning block size state that:

* A block must not be larger than 1MB.
* The block header must not be greater than 80 bytes
* The transaction counter must not be greater than 9 bytes.
