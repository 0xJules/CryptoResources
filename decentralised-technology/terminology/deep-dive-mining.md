# **Deep Dive : Mining**

The elected person we alluded to earlier, is known in the Bitcoin protocol as a **miner**.

As mentioned before, the reason we have miners is to stop 'double spend' attacks, whereby a bad actor tries to spend the same funds twice.  


We also alluded to the miners choosing batches of transactions and verifying them. In the Bitcoin protocol, the batches are known as **Blocks. ** They contain more than just the transactional information.
