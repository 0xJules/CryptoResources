# **Deep Dive : Mining**

The elected person we alluded to earlier, is known in the Bitcoin protocol as a **miner**.

As mentioned before, the reason we have miners is to stop 'double spend' attacks, whereby a bad actor tries to spend the same funds twice.

We also alluded to the miners choosing batches of transactions and verifying them. In the Bitcoin protocol, the batches are known as **Blocks. ** They contain more than just the transactional information. We will get to this when we get to the "Deep Dive: Blocks" chapter.

The miners must follow the Bitcoin consensus rules, which have a section that tells them how to verify transactions and how to submit a valid block.  
  
_Where can you find the list of consensus rules? _

In the code. To my knowledge there is no website that has gathered the explicit rules in terms of mining blocks and so in order to find them out, you will need to inspect the code and or ask another miner who has checked the code.  
  


We will now outline the process in which a miner adds a block onto the Bitcoin Blockchain:

1. The miner first
