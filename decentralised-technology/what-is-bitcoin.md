# What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, so a distributed decentralized database, in order to keep track of everyones 'accounts' and transaction history. Bitcoin uses a Peer to Peer network, so that each person on the Bitcoin network can communicate with each other, making sure that their databases are identical.  
  


**The Byzantine Generals Problem**

_Please note that the Two Generals Problem is unsolvable, while the Byzantine Generals Problem which is a generalisation is solvable._

10 generals want to attack a city. If they both do it at the same time, they will be able to take the city. If they do not co-ordinate their attack then the city will defeat them. The problem lies in that five generals are on one side of the city, and five on the other. Using a messenger, they need a send a message to the other side agreeing on a date and time to storm the city. The messenger has to go through the city in order to deliver the message, and as there is a chance that the message could be corrupted, the messenger cannot be trusted. How can these generals agree on a time and date using the messenger?

So the blockchain uses consensus algorithms to elect the next person who will add to the next block.
