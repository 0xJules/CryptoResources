# What Is Bitcoin?



Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, so a distributed decentralized database, in order to keep track of everyones 'accounts' and transaction history. Bitcoin uses a Peer to Peer network, so that each person on the Bitcoin network can communicate with each other, making sure that their databases are identical.
