# Problem

#### The problem that I hope to addresses, is community. For crypto to be great, we all must believe in the technology. Why does it need to be great? Because it will be here for the rest of your lives, and what we do now will shape the future of crypto and consequently our future, and our children's future. I get excited even trying to comprehend what is happening.

#### To believe in the technology, we must first understand the technology as best as we can. Whether you like it or not, crypto is here to stay and although most of you came for the bags, I need you to stay for the technology and the future.

# I am Non Techy I Want To Contribute

# Projects

#### Blockchain Foundations Book

The purpose of this is to explain cryptography and security in both a way that a non technical person can understand and in a way that a technical person can understand.

#### Bitcoin010:

Bitcoin010 is a bridging book into the Bitcoin world. It is made for those who have no idea about Bitcoin and want to understand it step by step. The book starts off with an analogy and each chapter builds upon the analogy, breaking down each concept in a digestible manner.

This book currently does not go into detail on:

* Extra Nonce
* Mining pools
* Sequence Number
* Block locktime
* ScriptHash

Most of the above were briefly mentioned in version one, and without going into detail on each of the above will still grant the reader enough knowledge to understand Bitcoin.

#### CoinJudge:

This is for the most part a subreddit, and is used as a safe haven for those who want to discuss crypto material using logic and do not want to be censored. It was initially created to alert the community of any ICOs / exchanges that seemed fraudulent in behaviour and or nature. Judgements were based on their white paper and the anonymity of their team amongst other things, hence the name Coinjudge.

#### **Smart Contract Coding Challenges:**

This was created as a tool to give new developers, a space to learn how to code smart contracts in a challenging way. Free to make mistakes and practice programming.

#### Youtube Channel - TheLondonBlockChain:

TheLondonBlockChain was created to give critical analysis to projects in the community via their white paper and their tech. We also teach programmers how to code smart contracts and the blockchain.
