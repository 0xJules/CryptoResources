# Problem

#### Let's talk about community and responsibility. For crypto to be great, we all must believe in the technology, take responsibility for what we have started. Why does it need to be great? Because it will be here for the rest of your lives. And what we do now will shape the future of crypto and consequently our future, and our children's future, and their children's future. 

#### Whether you like it or not, crypto is here to stay and although most of you came for the bags, I need you to stay for the technology and the future. Our future.

# I am Non Techy, I Still Want To Contribute

* We do videos that will cater towards paying your taxes and explaining concepts to the non technical. Your feedback on these would help out a lot.

* Every little helps. If you see something that you do not understand. I want to hear.

* If you are confused about a topic concerning crypto. I want to hear.

* Every question or problem you have about crypto, whether small or big, is important. Shoot me an email and I will do my best to answer you.

* Spread the news about our project.

* Donate towards the contributors, every satoshi helps!

* Subscribe to our projects.

# Projects

#### Blockchain Foundations:

Time taken: 13 hours

[Click here to read Bitcoin Foundations](/Foundations/README.md)

The purpose of this is to explain cryptography and security in both a way that a non technical person can understand and in a way that a technical person can understand.

#### Bitcoin010:

Time taken: ~ 240 hours

[Click here to read Bitcoin010](/Bitcoin010/README.md)

Bitcoin010 is a bridging book into the Bitcoin world. It is made for those who have no idea about Bitcoin and want to understand it step by step. The book starts off with an analogy and each chapter builds upon the analogy, breaking down each concept in a digestible manner.

This book currently does not go into detail on:

* Extra Nonce
* Mining pools
* Sequence Number
* Block locktime
* ScriptHash

Most of the above were briefly mentioned in version one, and without going into detail on each of the above will still grant the reader enough knowledge to understand Bitcoin.

#### CoinJudge:

[Click here to visit our reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/coinjudge/)

This is for the most part a subreddit, and is used as a safe haven for those who want to discuss crypto material using logic and do not want to be censored. It was initially created to alert the community of any ICOs / exchanges that seemed fraudulent in behaviour and or nature. Judgements were based on their white paper and the anonymity of their team amongst other things, hence the name Coinjudge.

#### **Smart Contract Coding Challenges:**

[Click here to visit our smart contract repo](https://github.com/decentralisedkev/SmartContractChallenges)

This was created as a tool to give new developers, a space to learn how to code smart contracts in a challenging way. Free to make mistakes and practice programming.

#### Youtube Channel - TheLondonBlockChain:

[Click here to visit our channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBWzcGSrtoLYcasLwGvsow)

TheLondonBlockChain was created to give critical analysis to projects in the community via their white paper and their tech. We also teach programmers how to code smart contracts and the blockchain.
